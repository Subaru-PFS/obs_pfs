  exposure:
    doc: >
      An observation associated with a particular instrument.  All direct
      observations are identified with an exposure, but derived datasets
      that may be based on more than one exposure (e.g. multiple snaps) are
      typically identified with visits instead, even for instruments that
      don't have multiple exposures per visit.  As a result, instruments
      that don't have multiple exposures per visit will typically have visit
      entries that are essentially duplicates of their exposure entries.

      The exposure table contains metadata entries that are relevant for
      calibration exposures, and does not duplicate entries in visit that
      would be the same for all exposures within a visit with the exception
      of the exposure.group entry.

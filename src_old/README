This software is free software. However, if you use this software to reduce any data used in a publication,
you must cite the paper:

A. Ritter, E. Hyde, Q. Parker, A fast and portable reimplementation of Piskunov and Valenti's optimal extraction algorithm with improved cosmic-ray removal and optimal sky subtraction, 2014, PASP 126

Before compiling any of the C++ programs you need to install the cfitsio, blitz++, and gsl libraries.

Please create symbolic link called 
/usr/include/c++/4 which points to the directory containing the bits directory which contains the stdc++.h file.

To install all libraries and compile all C++ programs copy and paste the following lines:
(if you get some error messages that files or symbolic links to be deleted don't exist the first time you compile it you can safely 
ignore them)

tar -zxvf cfitsio_latest.tar.gz
cd cfitsio
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
cd ..
tar -zxvf blitz-0.9.tar.gz
cd blitz-0.9
./configure --prefix=/usr/local 
make lib
sudo make install
cd ..
tar -zxvf gsl-1.16.tar.gz
cd gsl-1.16
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install
cd ..
echo 'compiling all sources - this will take a while...'
./make
cd ..
ln -s stella/tempexec ~/bin/tempexec

The last step points to a nonexistent file which is needed to execute C++ programs with long parameter lists from within IRAF.

After all libraries are installed, you can safely remove the tarballs:
rm cfitsio_latest.tar.gz blitz-0.9.tar.gz gsl-1.16.tar.gz

If you want to know what parameters a program has, simply start it without any parameters, and it will tell you.

Note that the C++ programs are constantly getting developed (a lot faster than the IRAF scripts encapsulating them), so there might be a few cases where the IRAF script is not yet supporting all the parameters of the executable version of the C++ program. If you find such a case please send an email to 

azuri.ritter@gmail.com

and I promise to fix that asap. Please also note that most of the parameter files in the stella/parameterfiles/ directory are not up to date. However, the IRAF script will tell you which parameters are missing, and assign standard values to the missing parameters. In this case please check the other parameter files for an example and explanation of the parameter.
At this stage the IRAF cl scripts encapsulating the C++ programs should only be seen as examples on how to implement the C++ programs in IRAF. The task stextract.cl is a good example if you want to start a compiled C++ program with a lot of parameters. Please also refer to loginuser.cl.

A kind of documentation (also outdated) for the IRAF scripts can be found at 

http://ooo.aip.de/stella/fileadmin/PublicDocuments/STELLA-pipeline/

I promise to write a proper documentation soon!!!

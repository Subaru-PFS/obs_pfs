# Response functions

These files describe the response functions of a variety of filters.
In each file, the first column is the wavelength (in nm) in the atmosphere,
and the second column is the response function.
The response functions include miscellaneous effects
such as those of the telescope, the CCD and the atmosphere.

## HSC

Computed by Masayuki Tanaka.

The response functions include
the primary mirror,
prime focus optics,
filter (averaged over the surface area),
CCD response,
and atmosphere (airmass=1.2 PVM=1.5mm).

## SDSS

Computed by Masayuki Tanaka.

The response functions include
the telescope (2 aluminum surfaces),
camera,
filter (average of the 6 columns),
CCD response,
and atmosphere (airmass=1.3).

## PS1
